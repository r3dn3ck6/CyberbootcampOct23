# In the game of Rock, Paper, Scissors, there are three possible moves for both the user and the computer: Rock, Paper, and Scissors. This leads to a total of 
# 3Ã—3=9 possible combinations when the user plays against the computer:

# User: Rock,  Computer: Rock
# User: Paper, Computer: Paper
# User: Scissors, Computer: Scissors

# User: Rock, Computer: Paper
# User: Rock, Computer: Scissors
# User: Paper, Computer: Rock
# User: Paper, Computer: Scissors
# User: Scissors, Computer: Rock
# User: Scissors, Computer: Paper

# Each combination results in a different outcome for the game, and each move has a specific interaction with the other moves: 
# Rock crushes Scissors, Scissors cuts Paper, and Paper covers Rock.
