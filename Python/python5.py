# Write a program that works out whether if a given number is an 
# odd or even number
# 🚨 Don't change the code below 👇
number = int(input("Which number do you want to check? "))
# 🚨 Don't change the code above 👆

#Write your code below this line 👇
if number % 2 == 0:

# Create a program using maths and f-Strings that tells us how many 
# days, weeks, months we have left if we live until 90 years old.

# It will take your current age as the input and output a message 
# with our time left in this format:

# You have x days, y weeks, and z months left.

# Where x, y and z are replaced with the actual calculated numbers.


# 🚨 Don't change the code below 👇
age = int(input("What is your current age? "))
# 🚨 Don't change the code above 👆

#Write your code below this line 👇
years_remaining = 90 - age
days_remaining = years_remaining * 365
weeks_remaining = years_remaining * 52
months_remaining = years_remaining * 12

print(f"You have {days_remaining} days, {weeks_remaining} weeks, and {months_remaining} months left until 90 years old.")
