# This script is a malware script designed to infect Python files with a virus. Here's a breakdown of what it does:

# Locate Function: This function recursively searches for Python files (*.py) in a given directory (path). It returns a list of files that do not contain the virus signature.

# Infect Function: This function opens the current script file (__file__), reads the first 39 lines, and stores them in the virusstring variable. Then, for each file in the list of files targeted, it reads the contents of the file, prepends the virusstring to the file content, and overwrites the file with the infected content.

# Detonate Function: This function checks if the current date is May 9th (datetime.datetime.now().month == 5 and datetime.datetime.now().day == 9). If

# the current date matches May 9th, it prints "You have been hacked".

# Main Execution: The script first calls the locate function to find Python files in the current directory. Then, it calls the infect function to infect those files with the virus. Finally, it calls the detonate function to check if it should trigger the "You have been hacked" message.
# This script demonstrates a malicious attempt to infect Python files with a virus and execute a payload on a specific date. 
# It's important to note that running such a script can cause serious harm to your system and should never be executed.
