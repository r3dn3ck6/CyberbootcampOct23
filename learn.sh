# Prompt user for input directory path
directory_path = input("Please enter the directory path:")

# Add your code logic below to handle the provided directory path
print("The directory path provided is:", directory_path)


# Add your code logic below to handle the provided directory path


# In this example, when you run the script, it will display the message 
# "Please enter the directory path: " and wait for the user to provide input. 
# Once the user enters the desired directory path and presses Enter, 
# the 'input()' function will capture the user input and assign it to the 'directory_path' variable.

# You can then use the 'directory_path' variable to perform any further operations
# or validations on the directory path as per your requirements.

# Note: Ensure that you provide clear instructions to the user on how they should 
# enter the directory path to avoid any confusion or errors.

#How Do I find the directy_path for input
# The directory_path for input is typically the location where the file or folder is stored on your computer's file system. You can find the directory path for input by following these steps:

# Identify the file or folder you want to find the directory path for.
# Open the file explorer or file manager on your computer (e.g., Windows Explorer, macOS Finder, etc.).
# Navigate to the location of the file or folder within the file explorer or file manager.
# Once you reach the desired location, you can see the directory path in the address bar or navigation panel of the file explorer or file manager.
# On Windows, the directory path typically starts with a drive letter (e.g., C:) followed by the directory names separated by backslashes (e.g., C:\Users\Username\Documents).
# On macOS, the directory path typically starts with a forward slash (/) and includes the directory names separated by forward slashes (e.g., /Users/Username/Documents).
# Make sure you locate the specific input file or folder within the file explorer or file manager to obtain the correct directory path.


directory_path = ("C:/Home/Desktop: ")
print("The directory path provided is:", directory_path)

The code provided is syntactically correct. 
However, it will throw an error because input() function does not accept a parameter for displaying a prompt to the user.
